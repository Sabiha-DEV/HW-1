<P>Flowers are one of natures most beautiful gifts to man and it would not be wrong to say that the blooming of a flower in itself symbolises life. plants produce flowers because they contain the male and female reproductive organs. Like human beings plants also need to transfer Pollen from the male reproductive organs to the female ones. Unlike human beings and animals, plants cannot move so they need to attract other creatures which can do this job for them and for this purpose they produce flowers. Flowers have a delicate but complex structure and no two flowers are alike. Before blooming, a flower is in the shape of a bud and is covered on the outside with scaly and rough sepals.

    Once a flower blooms, these sepals open up and the inner petals arc uncovered. Plants use these brightly coloured petals to attract insects like butterflies and bees. Housed inside the petals are the styles and above these are the anthers covered with pollen. To fertilise a female cell, the pollen on the anthers must reach the ovary, below the style, in another flower. Attracted by the colour of the flowers, bees and butterflies come to feed on the nectar and pollen, as they fly away to another flower, they carry with them grains of pollen stuck to their legs. This pollinates the other flower and helps plants in reproducing. Besides this there are other types of plants which produce a pollen which is light enough to be carried by the wind. Grass for example is a flowering plant which produces pollen. Since flowers have been used over the ages for decoration as well, many types of flowers are grown in house gardens and nurseries. Florists sell beautiful bouquets of these all around the year. Flowers are also used today to manufacture scented soaps and perfumes. Different types of flowers are found all over the world and many of them may have disappeared, due to deforestation, even before man saw them.</P>>
